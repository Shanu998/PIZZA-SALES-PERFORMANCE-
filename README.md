## RECOMMENDATIONS

- Boost Promotions for Large Size Pizzas: With L size contributing nearly half of total sales, targeted campaigns can further amplify revenue.

- Optimize Inventory for Top-Selling Flavors: Focus stocking strategies on high-performing variants like Thai Chicken and Barbecue Chicken Pizzas.

- Enhance Mid-Week Sales with Discounts: Orders peak on Fridays; incentivizing mid-week orders (Tuesdays & Wednesdays) could balance demand.

- Seasonal Marketing Campaigns: Leverage months with lower order volume (October, December) for promotions to increase sales during slow periods.

- Category-Specific Pricing Strategy: Adjust pricing for Classic pizzas to potentially increase Average Order Value while retaining volume.

- Menu Optimization: Reassess XXL pizza offerings due to their minimal contribution (0.12%) to total sales.

- Customer Segmentation Analysis: Utilize detailed order patterns to segment customers and tailor personalized offers for repeat purchases.
